? Ability to filter projects by AM
* Implement Risk
* Export project tasks to Google Calendar format
- Better styling
* Add ability to attach files (as part of Comments?)
* Make AM a User
* Add MRR for projects
* sign on with WPEngine email
* move clone from views to utils for DRY
Notes from actually spending a day entering data:
* Description field could be better-used. And consistent. Some times it's required, others it's not.
* Cloning projects is the way to go. Maybe parlay this into project templates?
* Add ability to expand/contract comments on individual tasks
* There is no ability, anywhere, to delete tasks.
* Add ability to preview comments before submitting (due to the Markdown thing)
* ignore upper/lowercase when alphabetizing projects
