Notes from actually spending a day entering data:
* Description field could be better-used. And consistent. Some times it's required, others it's not.
* Cloning projects is the way to go. Maybe parlay this into project templates?
* Add ability to expand/contract comments on individual tasks
+ There is no ability, anywhere, to delete tasks.
+ Add ability to preview comments before submitting (due to the Markdown thing)
+ ignore upper/lowercase when alphabetizing projects

+ Add "release notes" page
+ Account Managers list is still not unique
+ Filter by AM page now necessary due to weekly sync-up
* Implement risk score correctly
* Project "due today" button for tasks
* Finish expanding comments
* Add comment count next to item if there are comments
* Tie in to migration checklist?
* Last ticket response time doesn't reflect accurately in the risk score
* Make link to overdrive something that automatically happens
