+ Ability to filter projects by PM

+ 404 page
+ 500 page
+ Turn DEBUG off
* sign on with WPEngine email
+ webhooks (see below):
webhook info:
hit a url implementation.wpengine.com/web-hook
send type of object and object id and unix timestamp
+ POST-based API
+ Improve task detail screen
+ Add edit task to tasklist detail screen
+ reload tasks upon task completion to resolve dependencies
* move clone from views to utils for DRY
+ tasks/projects need "not started" "in progress" "completed" status

Notes from actually spending a day entering data:
* Description field could be better-used. And consistent. Some times it's required, others it's not.
+ Add a tasklist screen does not have any indication telling me what I'm doing.
+ Would be nice to add tasks to tasklist by clicking a button on project detail.
+ There is no way to get to the project from the tasklist detail page.
* Cloning projects is the way to go. Maybe parlay this into project templates?
+ Latest projects -- is this useful? We move at such a fast speed that it's mostly the same as active projects. Plus, the sorting on Latest projects is off.

Reporting possibilities:
+ Project has a start date in the past but is not marked as In Progress
+ Project has a due date in the past but is not marked Complete
x Project end date after due date

+ Add ability to view completed tasks.
+ Convert newlines in comment boxes to HTML
+ Add destination pod
+ Add handoff type
